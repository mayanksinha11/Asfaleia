Sir,I have created a few Raspberry Pi projects but they are base on a single program.
As I am new to GitHub I don't know how to use multiple programs for a project? 
Do I need to run all of these codes separately? I think "NO".
But don't know how to run these programs at a lump..


Ssir, please help me once.
